This project aims to implement a neural network model for handwritten digit recognition on an
ESP32 microcontroller using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite). The model, trained on the MNIST dataset, will
be optimized and converted to TFLite format. The deployment of this model on the ESP32 will enable
real-time digit recognition with high accuracy and low power consumption, demonstrating the potential
of integrating machine learning with low-cost, low-power hardware for embedded applications.
